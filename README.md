Optimally distribute weighted and ordered topics across weeks of a semester

## Description

The software assumes that you need to distribute teaching contents across the weeks of a semester. There are more topics than weeks. The topics have a certain importance (weight) and need to be teached in a given order, i.e. they must not be reordered. You want to optimally distribute the topics across the weeks such that each week carries topics with the same weight as far as it is possible. This software will perform an exhaustive search and report an optimal solution.

## How to use

1. Adjust the variables `topics` and `nr_weeks` to your needs.
2. Open the file in a webbrowser, the calculation will immediately start (for large inputs the browser may hang and/or you may need to instruct it to continue the calculation)
3. Open the the browser's JavaScript console (usually with F12) to see the program's output
